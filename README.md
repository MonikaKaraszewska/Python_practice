# Python Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository, **Python Practice**, is dedicated to practicing and improving coding skills in Python. It contains a collection of scripts and exercises that explore various concepts in Python programming. The goal is to enhance understanding of Python through hands-on coding and experimentation.

## Key Features

- **Diverse Exercises**: The repository includes a variety of exercises covering fundamental concepts, data structures, and algorithms. Examples include:
  - Mathematical calculations and functions (e.g., `CAS_03_sum_of_n_numbers_26.py`)
  - Games and simulations (e.g., `CAS_L02_number_game.py`, `CAS_L04_Simulation.py`)
  - String manipulation and regular expressions (e.g., `String_Ex`)
  - Working with lists, dictionaries, and other data structures (e.g., `Dictionary`, `filter_map_lambda_ex`)

- **Structured Learning**: The exercises are organized into folders based on topics, making it easy to navigate and find relevant code examples.

- **Hands-on Practice**: Each script serves as a practical application of Python concepts, allowing for experimentation and learning through coding.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for writing all the scripts and exercises.

## Goals

- Improve Python programming skills through practical exercises and challenges.
- Explore various aspects of coding, including functions, loops, and data manipulation.
- Build a solid foundation for future projects and advanced programming concepts.

Feel free to explore the scripts, try them out, and modify them to further enhance your learning experience!
